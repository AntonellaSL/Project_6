            We offer a range of <strong>therapeutic</strong> and <strong>educational programs</strong> centered around planting. Our goal is to support survivors of abuse as they heal from post-traumatic experiences and to inspire young children with the joys of growing their own plants. Through the act of nurturing living things, we help individuals find peace, resilience, and a connection to the healing power of nature.
